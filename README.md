# Project-EduChem

 * there are still a lot of bugs
 * sometimes it seems as if there are too many colliders for the panto
 * some of the colliders have to be rearranged because yoou can slip between them
 * maybe you need to restart it one or two times before it works
 * im not quite sure if lvl 3 is working on every device rigth now, my Unity screws up
 * there is also a command missing to search for atoms you can't find
 * there is a collider in the middle of the playfield, and I don't know what it is
